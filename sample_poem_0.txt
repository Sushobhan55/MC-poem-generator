Bird-shaped block, pure a lovely loves, Each day 
your thumbs smoothed my old times, Iâ€™d be still. 
The room away, or sink, And I would be known: But mark that purged of some 
private Soviet 
Union you at its knowledge you sleep 
Department of ice, to always think of gloom: What I grow 
young, my sister.
