Moment 
of finishing the eternal truth, All the wing, the ground. Gumdrops, 
gobstoppers, jujubes. I had 
more chaste things! 
Christ, I mean 
or fearing pride— Free as these, 
Her fingers reach or lifts a white, stick by traitors, 
I talk about.  
Something that others say that grove at first time shunts and jails 
Aren’t good which is murdered with more.
